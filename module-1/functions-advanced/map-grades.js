/*
Imagine you are a Math teacher and you have to grade our students based on 
their performance on two projects (40% of final grade) and their final exam (60% of final grade). 
We got the info for each student in an object that looks like this:

{
  name: "Student Name",
  firstProject: 80,
  secondProject: 75,
  finalExam: 90

}
So the whole class is represented as an array of objects (each object contains 
the data about that student), and we need to get a new array of objects, 
but this time the objects will contain only student´s name, 
and their final grade. Let´s do it.

const students = [
  {
    name: 'Tony Parker',
    firstProject: 80,
    secondProject: 75,
    finalExam: 90
  },
